# CalenderGenerator
This code is a basic Python program that generates a calendar for a given year and month. It uses the built-in calendar module to generate the calendar, and prompts the user to input a year and month. If the input is valid, the program generates the calendar for that year and month and prints it to the console. The program includes an if-else statement to handle invalid inputs, and prints an error message if the user enters an invalid year or month.

This code could be used as the basis for a simple command-line tool to generate calendars, or could be integrated into a larger application that requires calendar functionality.
